this is it, what I've been working on in some form or another for the
last several years, and the first of my inventions that I've developed
enough that I'm ready to set it loose in the wild. When I started I
wasn't even sure if the idea would work, it seemed too simple and
straightforward to have not been noticed, so I figured I was probably
missing something and it just wouldn't work. The few experiments I
managed to hack together seemed to point to the opposite being true
however, so I taught myself enough basic electronics to figure it out.
From my first real attempt that failed because I didn't properly
understand transistors and designed it wrong, to the first working
build that required around 26 volts alongside the logic voltage, to the
most recent version that crams it all into a single 5 volt source, its
been a long process for me. If this is as useful as I think it is
though, it'll have been worth every minute. Details in the pdf
below.<br>

Addendum.<br>
A couple details that didn't make it into the pdf, which I may add during a later edit, but for now will remain here.<br>
            <br>
First, tri-state logic.<br>
Modern electronics don't use binary, full stop. While the calculations
are in binary, the calculating is done in hardware that is a form of
trinary. With tri-state logic, we have a high state, a low state, and a
high z (disconnected) state, this is three distinct states, this is
trinary (or ternary if you prefer). This is why I decided to call all
this high-state, I see it as a logical extension of tri-state. A true
binary system would be something built purely in DRL(Diode-Resistor
Logic), or something similar. As soon as you add the ability to
disconnect, the system is no longer two state, it's three state, and
three state is not binary.<br>
            <br>
Next, differential signaling.<br>
If Hexa-State bits are implemented, as described in the pdf, and a full
complement set of negative voltages are generated, we can have
high-state differential signaling. Done this way, the conversion from
binary to HSDS (High-State Differential Signaling) and back,
essentially becomes a "nibble wide" SerDes! Hexa-State HSDS could
transfer a full byte in two clock cycles, with the inherent noise
immunity of differential signaling!<br>
