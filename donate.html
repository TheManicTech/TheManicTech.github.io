            <br>
            <br>
When I set out to build the circuitry described in my paper &#8220;Redefining
bits&#8221;, I only intended to offer a replacement for USB, and had hoped to
get a few financial donations to help me with the next projects in
line. Just getting the thing working took me a few years, while I
taught myself enough basic electronics to figure out what I was doing
wrong in my first attempts. During this process, I started to realize
the far reaching implications of what I was developing, and decided to
make it my primary focus.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
At the point when I realized that I had something truly useful and
unique, I was faced with the fact that there are no formal paths to
releasing my work, short of selling out to corporate greed, or going it
alone and hoping for the best. As I mention in &#8220;Redefining bits&#8221;, the
idea was formed as a result of anger and frustration at aforementioned
corporate greed, so that option was out. When all is said and done,
these concepts are for the advancement of humanity, and as such, rights
to them are not to go to a single source, such would be inappropriate.
So I&#8217;m choosing the latter, I&#8217;m going this alone, releasing this all
into the public domain (where the core concepts already are anyway),
and falling on the good of humanity to support my needs. We&#8217;ll see how
this works out for me...<br>
            <br>
            <br>
I have a lot more inventions/designs I want to bring to the world, most
I don't intend to sell but to release into the public domain. From a
much safer steam engine, to a likely DIYable epaper like display, to a
far more effective evaporation cooler, to, well, lets just leave it
there. I have some retro style gaming/computing projects, a basic
digital electronics educational kit, and a unique alternative to
electronics breadboards, that are all in various stages of development
as well. The retro style gaming/computing projects will likely be for
sale, not free. I&#8217;m not certain however, I may still release everything
open source, and just sell finished units...not sure yet. That&#8217;s just a
few of my ideas, there's a whole lot more&#8230;and I do mean a lot. To get
much further though, I need stability in life for my family and I. We
don&#8217;t have a home to call our own, and currently survive on the
handouts of others, staying with family and friends. For many reasons
that I wont address here, the majority of which were not my own doing,
I have not yet been able to achieve financial stability in life. If I
can get enough donations quickly enough, I intend to pay off my debts
(paying back those who have loaned me money to survive and
similar...you wouldn&#8217;t be helping me pay off debts for toys or fun
stuff), purchase a piece of land, build a house and a proper workshop
on said land, and spend the majority of my time developing technologies
to help humankind in the variety of ways I find myself capable. This
also includes growing gardens to produce more food than my family can
eat, specifically for the purpose of giving the surplus away to local
people in need. And some other stuff that may or may not happen,
depending on tenability.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
As our world falls apart around us, I find myself with many good and
useful ideas/designs/inventions. Some of my deepest desires in life are
to use the giftings I have to help others. At this point I fully
believe I can do so if I can achieve financial stability. The question
is, are there enough others out there that would want to help me
achieve my own needs, so that I can be able to do what I can? I won't
ever know if I don't reach out and ask, so this is me asking. I refuse,
as I always have, to willfully steal what I need in any way. As it is,
nearly everything I have has been given to me. I have mental disorder
which both hampers my existence, and gives me a perspective that allows
me to invent some really cool stuff. It&#8217;s only now, after very much
practice, that I can express myself in writing well enough to talk
about what I can do and what I need. And for reasons I won't address
here, my mental disorder is undiagnosed, so very few take me seriously.
In fact, many have misunderstood my words and intentions, and I&#8217;ve been
dealt much damage by some who thought they had the right to punish me
for what their misinterpretations decided I was...likely not realizing
the extremity of the damage they were doing, most of the time,
seemingly not caring at all. I say these things not to evoke pity, I
don't want pity, I simply aim to provide perspective as to why I find
myself in such need, in spite of my capabilities. I can&#8217;t promise that
any of my other ideas will work, or will work as well as I think they
will. That said, most of what I&#8217;m currently actively developing in any
way, would seriously surprise me if they didn&#8217;t work. The circuit
described in &#8220;Redefining bits&#8221;, was far more of a moonshot when I
started, than most of my current projects. What I can and do promise
though, is to do my best making it all work, and to not get greedy when
releasing it all. My goal is not to become wealthy. And if wealth finds
me, I&#8217;m unlikely to keep much of it. Anyone who can sit on wealth and
not use it to help others, in this world where so many suffer while
having done no wrong, has a lack of understanding of the ways our
existence functions. Selfishness is shortsighted. All the nearsighted
knuckleheads profiteering off their fellow human beings, really ought
to get themselves some glasses and have another look around. I need
some resources for me so I can survive and be productive, that&#8217;s why
I&#8217;m reaching out and asking. If I get more than I need, I&#8217;ll pass it
along in one form or another. Putting extra resources in my hands would
simply allow me to build more, it wouldn&#8217;t make me fat and lazy while I
go after excess and extravagance...excess is for
sharing/growing/building, not wallowing in.<br>
